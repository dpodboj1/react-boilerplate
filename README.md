# react-boilerplate

A simple React boilerplate which was made while experimenting with Babel and Webpack. The main goal was to figure out how Babel and Webpack work and how to configure them without resorting to create-react-app immediately. 

Feel free to use it or contribute in any way you want! 

You can always use Facebook's create-react-app if you'd like [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
